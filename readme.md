# Description
This third project is a site with 2 applications that can be used by developers. One creates paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text to use as site-filler. The other creates a list of random user names, both creating an amount chosen by the user of the tools.

# Details for teaching team
Tried to incorporate P2 into P3. Worked fine on local machine, but nothing but blank screens on production. Removed code as I don't have enough time to troubleshoot the problem.
HTML validates.

# Outside code
Packages badcow/lorem-ipsum and fzaninotto/faker were used.
